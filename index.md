**What is the most interesting topic covered in your domain this quarter?**
I think how nuanced our project is. There are so many different ways to approach misinformation.
**Describe a potential investigation you would like to pursue for your Quarter 2 Project.**
I would like to investigate the potential of Generative ai in this project. I think it will open more doors in terms of creating new context data and generating context as to why some parts of articles may be misleading.
**What is a potential change youâ€™d make to the approach taken in your current Quarter 1 Project?**
I think that I would try to research more how other people have potentially tried to quantify some factuality factors, or seek novel methods and advice in quantifying them.
**What other techniques would you be interested in using in your project?**
I would be interested in using generative ai in my project. It would be interesting to make api calls to ChatGPT or BardAi or even create a CustomGpt for the projet
